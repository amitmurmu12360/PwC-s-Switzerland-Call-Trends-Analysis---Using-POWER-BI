- Utilized Power Query in Power BI to clean and transform the dataset.
- Created calculated columns, including a custom date and time column for time-based analysis.

**Data Analysis**:
- Created a wide range of KPIs and metrics, including customer satisfaction, calls answered/abandoned, calls by time, speed of answer, agent performance, and more.
- Explored long-term trends and analyzed data over time.

**Visualizations**:
- Developed various visualizations to convey key insights.
- Created line charts, pie charts, bar charts, and gauge charts.
- Utilized slicers for dynamic filtering and interactivity.

**Advanced Analytics**:
- Calculated unresolved calls, resolved calls, and their percentages.
- Analyzed call outcomes, such as resolution rate and escalation.

**User Interface Design**:
